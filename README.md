# LetaBotSC2
LetaBot for StarCraft 2 (currently only test bot)



How to run it:


1.  Unrar the bin.rar in a folder. As long as the .exe and .txt are in the same folder, it should work

2. Download the ladder maps from the SC2 bot API github (  
https://github.com/Blizzard/s2client-proto#downloads  ) and put the .SC2Map files in a folder called "Maps" in your StarCraft 2 installation folder (make the "Maps" folder yourself if it doesn't exists). 

The .rar password can be found on the SC2 bot API github linked above

3.  

If you don't have the visual c++ 2017 redistributable, you can download it from here

https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/

ctrl+f  
redistributable

And you will find it. (download the x64 version)



Once these three steps are done, you can run the .exe . Make sure to check if it isn't blocked by the firewall. It should run without admin privileges, but I only tested it on a Windows 7. So it could be different in another OS.
