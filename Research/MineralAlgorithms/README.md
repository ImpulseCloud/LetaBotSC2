Mineral Gathering algorithms from my BW bot implemented in SC2.
Still have to run to get enough results.

To run: just follow the instructions to run LetaBot:
https://github.com/MartinRooijackers/LetaBotSC2/blob/master/README.md

Dont forget to keep the .txt files in the same folder as the .exe ,

the AlgorithmChoice.txt  also contains text below to indicate which number belongs to which algorithm
